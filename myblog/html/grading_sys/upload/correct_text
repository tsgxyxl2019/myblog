The Clown Frogfish is a rare species found off the coast of Indonesia. It is a member of the Frogfish family, typically known for their astounding camouflage. Most inexperienced marine biologists would have a difficult time discerning a Clown Frogfish from its surrounding coral as they tend to be brightly coloured and irregularly shaped. Some species of the fish even have the ability to mimic the colours around them.
